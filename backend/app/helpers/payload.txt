Under Soviet rule, so much water was diverted from the rivers for agricultural purposes that salinity levels rapidly rose and the sea shrank. There was an upsurge in dust storms containing toxic salt residue, and a new desert began to replace the sea. At the same time, agricultural runoff rendered the drinking water unfit for human consumption. In this book Erika Weinthal examines how the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan have tackled the Aral Sea Basin crisis since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. The Amu Darya now flows through three new nation-states, and the Syr Darya through four. This shakeup of political borders created a collective-action problem for the successor states. While they needed to consolidate domestic sovereignty, they also needed to relinquish sovereignty over their water resources in order to develop a joint solution to the desiccation of the Aral Sea. Weinthal examines why they were able to cooperate over their shared water resources. She emphasizes the roles of nonstate actors (international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and bilateral aid organizations) in the building of institutions for regional cooperation and for state formation, shows how cooperation was nested within the state-building process when international third-party actors were involved, and highlights the dispensing of side payments (financial and material resources) by nonstate actors to aid both regional cooperation and state formation.', 'cites_id': '6606083234776692379', 'eprint': 'http://www.academia.edu/download/30775385/PNADF987.pdf#page=122', 'keywords': ['regional cooperation state', 'nonstate actors', 'cooperation state', 'cooperation state formation', 'state formation', 'water resources', 'weinthal examines', 'regional cooperation', 'residue desert', 'residue desert began']}, {'title': 'Prelude to the resource curse: Explaining oil and gas development strategies in the Soviet successor states and beyond', 'cites': '195', 'year': '2001', 'url': 'https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0010414001034004002', 'author': 'Pauline Jones Luong and Erika Weinthal', 'journal': 'Comparative Political Studies', 'volume': '34', 'number': '4', 'pages': '367-399', 'publisher': 'Sage Publications', 'abstract': 'The literature on resource-rich states leaves a key and prior question unexplored: Why and how do states choose to develop their natural resources?

We benchmark the classification framework by using a publicly available dataset of Twitter bots.

Our models yield high accuracy and agreement with each other and can detect bots of different nature. Our estimates suggest that between 9% and 15% of active Twitter accounts are bots.

Knowledge claims at the research front are more likely to be transitory and are therefore problematic as indicators of quality. Citation impact studies focus on short-term citation, and therefore tend to measure not epistemic quality, but involvement in current discourses in which contributions are positioned by referencing. We explore this argument using three case studies: (1) citations of the journal Soziale Welt as an example of a venue that tends not to publish papers at a research front, unlike, for example, JACS; (2) Robert Merton as a concept symbol across theories of citation; and (3) the Multi-RPYS (“Multi-Referenced Publication Year Spectroscopy”) of the journals Scientometrics, Gene, and Soziale Welt. We show empirically that the measurement of “quality” in terms of citations can further be qualified: short-term citation currency at the research front can be distinguished from longer-term processes of incorporation and codification of knowledge claims into bodies of knowledge.

In this paper we present OSLOM (Order Statistics Local Optimization Method), the first method capable to detect clusters in networks accounting for edge directions, edge weights, overlapping communities, hierarchies and community dynamics. It is based on the local optimization of a fitness function expressing the statistical significance of clusters with respect to random fluctuations, which is estimated with tools of Extreme and Order Statistics. OSLOM can be used alone or as a refinement procedure of partitions/covers delivered by other techniques.

Stimuli in AR were presented in two different frames of reference - screen-stabilized or world-fixed. Responses to signals in AR were significantly faster than to signals in the environment, suggesting a dominance of virtual information over real ones.

Instead, it talks about the ways computers are used in education and compares the various uses from the teacher's point of view. In short, this book concentrates on people—not on machines.

We see this development as a consequence of an increased awareness and recognition of what broadly could be labeled as a design perspective. We examine the transformational process, the metamorphosis, by which non-designer students become interaction designers. We identify and describe the barriers that make it difficult for the students to move through this transformational process. We also propose some pedagogical approaches that can reduce the barriers and improve the possibility for the transformation to occur. The approach that we have developed and describe consists of three parts. Based on a fundamental understanding of the nature of design, we have developed (i) a tentative transformational model of how non-designers become interaction designers;(ii) a special kind of conceptual framework used to support students in the transformational process; and (iii) design assignments based on real-world design problems. We end the paper with two conclusions. First we argue that there is a challenge in transforming non-designers into designers, but that it is possible if the educational effort is based on an understanding of design and on the transformational process with its barriers.

Social media is now an indispensable mode of communication; online gaming is not only a genuine social activity but also a popular spectator sport. With support for anonymity and larger audiences, online interaction shrinks social and geographical barriers. Despite such benefits, social disparities such as gender inequality persist in online social media. In particular, online gaming communities have been criticized for persistent gender disparities and objectification. As gaming evolves into a social platform, persistence of gender disparity is a pressing question. Yet, there are few large-scale, systematic studies of gender inequality and objectification in social gaming platforms. Here we analyze more than one billion chat messages from Twitch, a social game-streaming platform, to study how the gender of streamers is associated with the nature of conversation. Using a combination of computational text analysis methods, we show that gendered conversation and objectification is prevalent in chats. Female streamers receive significantly more objectifying comments while male streamers receive more game-related comments. This difference is more pronounced for popular streamers. There also exists a large number of users who post only on female or male streams.

Our central finding is that the lived experience of menopause is social: menopause is less about bodily experiences by themselves and more about how experiences with the body become meaningful over time in the social context. We find that gendered marginalization shapes diverse social relationships, leading to widespread feelings of alienation and negative transformation-often expressed in semantically dense figurative language. Research and design can accordingly address menopause not only as a women's health concern, but also as a …", 'cites_id': '6354694346739793488', 'eprint': 'https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10093451', 'keywords': ['accordingly address', 'menopause social', 'menopause womens', 'menopause womens health', 'methodologies center', 'methodologies center knowledge', 'negative transformationoften', 'negative transformationoften expressed', 'physiological emotional', 'physiological emotional social']}, {'title': 'Integrating roboticist values into a Value Sensitive Design framework for humanoid robots', 'cites': '18', 'year': '2016', 'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7451775/', 'author': 'EunJeong Cheon and Norman Makoto Su', 'pages': '375-382', 'publisher': 'IEEE', 'abstract': "A good body of work in HRI has investigated how to design humanoids to effectively serve users' needs.

To fill this gap, this study compares 11 altmetrics with Web of Science citations for 76 to 208,739 PubMed articles with at least one altmetric mention in each case and up to 1,891 journals per metric. It also introduces a simple sign test to overcome biases caused by different citation and usage windows. Statistically significant associations were found between higher metric scores and higher citations for articles with positive altmetric scores in all cases with sufficient evidence (Twitter, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blogs, mainstream media and forums) except perhaps for Google+ posts. Evidence was insufficient for LinkedIn, Pinterest, question and answer sites, and Reddit, and no conclusions should be drawn about articles with zero altmetric scores or the strength of any correlation between altmetrics and citations. Nevertheless, comparisons between citations and metric values for articles published at different times, even within the same year, can remove or reverse this association and so publishers and scientometricians should consider the effect of time when using altmetrics to rank articles.

Here we present a systematic approach to identifying and analyzing scientists on Twitter. Our method can identify scientists across many disciplines, without relying on external bibliographic data, and be easily adapted to identify other stakeholder groups in science. We investigate the demographics, sharing behaviors, and interconnectivity of the identified scientists. We find that Twitter has been employed by scholars across the disciplinary spectrum, with an over-representation of social and computer and information scientists; under-representation of mathematical, physical, and life scientists; and a better representation of women compared to scholarly publishing. Analysis of the sharing of URLs reveals a distinct imprint of scholarly sites, yet only a small fraction of shared URLs are science-related.

To understand decisions in the real world, we need a different, more psychologically plausible notion of rationality, and this book provides it. It is about fast and frugal heuristics--simple rules for making decisions when time is pressing and deep thought an unaffordable luxury. These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices, classifications, and predictions by employing bounded rationality.

Simple Heuristics explores these questions, developing computational models of heuristics and testing them through experiments and analyses. It shows how fast and frugal heuristics can produce adaptive decisions in situations as varied as choosing a mate, dividing resources among offspring, predicting high school drop out rates, and playing the stock market.

These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices quickly and with a minimum of information by exploiting the way that information is structured in particular environments. In this précis, we show how simple building blocks that control information search, stop search, and make decisions can be put together to form classes of heuristics, including: ignorance-based and one-reason decision making for choice, elimination models for categorization, and satisficing heuristics for sequential search.

As the merits of brainstyle computation (Rumelhart 1990) have become apparent, a bewildering variety of connectionist applications has cropped up throughout the cognitive sciences and engineering (for instance, see Lippmann, Moody, and Touretzky 1991). One of the central issues in all of these models is the representation of knowledge in the connectionist network. Getting a coherent picture of" what goes on" inside a network as it develops, manipulates, and alters the representation of the knowledge it processes is vital for our understanding of connectionist information processing, and likely for our understanding of the minds these systems model. In this chapter we explore the sorts of representations that connectionist systems employ and the crucial role learning plays in constructing them.The representational materials that connectionist systems have to work with are remarkably simple. A connectionist network can basically be described as a collection of simple processing units, each of which has a current state of activation, linked together by a set of connections, each of which has a current strength or weight (see fig. 1.1). The weighted connections modify the activation values that they pass among the processing units. One set of units is typically assigned the special role of receiving inputs from the" external world"; these input units have their activation values set (at least in part) by an external stimulus. Another set of units is usually designated as the outputs of the system; the activation values of these output units is monitored as the final result of processing by the network.

Behind them streamed the great river of light with its several tributaries. But the Milky Way churned beneath me as well, for my hut was set in the middle of a large patchwork of rice paddies, separated from each other by narrow two-foot-high dikes, and these paddies were all filled with water. By day, the surface of the pools reflected perfectly the blue sky, or the monsoon clouds, a reflection broken only by the thin, bright green tips of new rice.

I might perhaps have been able to reorient myself, to regain some sense of ground and gravity, were it not for a fact that confounded my senses entirely: between the galaxies below and the constellations above drifted countless fireflies, their lights flickering like the stars, some drifting up to join the clusters of stars overhead, others, like graceful meteors, slipping down from above to join the constellations underfoot, and all these paths of light upward and downward were mirrored in the still surface of the paddies.

Rather than applying various band-aid solutions to environmental problems, adherents of deep ecology ostensibly ask “deeper” questions, and aim at deeper, more longrange solutions. Yet some stalwart environmental activists have taken offense at the implication that their own strenuous efforts merely amount to a kind of “shallow” ecology. In fact, the implicit contrast between “deep” and “shallow” approaches to ecological problems has led various folks to suspect a kind of arrogance in the very idea of a “deep” ecology; and such suspicions have served to somewhat weaken, and marginalize, the deep ecology movement in recent years.Yet the tremendous potential of the deep ecology movement, and the real eloquence of deep ecology as a powerful, if largely inchoate, set of intuitions, never really had anything to do, I believe, with the facile contrast between “deep” and “shallow” approaches.

The shelf life of the product is thereby extended, but of course these foods are also enjoyed around the world for their organoleptic qualities. They are also important to the brewing and winemaking industries, where they are often undesirable intruders but can in specific cases have desirable benefits. The LAB are also used in producing silage and other agricultural animal feeds. Clinically, they can improve the digestive health of young animals, and also have human medical applications.
