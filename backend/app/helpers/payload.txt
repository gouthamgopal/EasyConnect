Most of the existing approaches attempt at solving this problem by making some simplifying assumptions such as that of a stationary background. However, this might not always be the case, as swaying trees or ripples in the water often violate these assumptions. In this paper, we present a novel method for modeling background of a dynamic scene, i.e., scenes that contain “non-stationary” background motions, such as periodic motions (e.g., pendulums or escalators) or dynamic textures (e.g., water fountain in the background, swaying trees, or water ripples, etc.). The paper proposes single-class support vector machine (SVM), and we show why it is preferable to other scene modeling techniques currently in use for this particular problem.

This paper proposes a blind blur estimation technique based on the low rank approximation of cepstrum. The key idea that this paper presents is that the blur functions usually have low ranks when compared with ranks of real images and can be estimated from cepstrum of degraded images. We extend this idea and propose a general framework for estimation of any type of blur. We show that the proposed technique can correctly estimate commonly used blur types both in noiseless and noisy cases. Experimental results for a wide variety of conditions i.e., when images have low resolution, large blur support, and low signal-to-noise ratio, have been presented to validate our proposed method.', 'cites_id': '13820135331673577995', 'eprint': 'https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/aabhutta/pdf/ICIAR2006_cepstrum.pdf', 'keywords': ['degraded images', 'approximation cepstrum', 'rank approximation cepstrum', 'proposed technique correctly', 'proposes blind', 'proposes blind blur', 'quality image', 'quality image restoration', 'rank approximation', 'ranks compared']}]}, {'researcher': 'Saul Blanco', 'scholars_link': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p5fxQKkAAAAJ', 'iu_link': 'https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?Saul_Blanco', 'id': 'p5fxQKkAAAAJ', 'url_picture': 'https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=medium_photo&user=p5fxQKkAAAAJ', 'email': '@unileon.es', 'citedby': 3799, 'affiliation': 'Diatom Lab - University of León', 'papers': [{'title': 'Long-term operation of high rate algal ponds for the bioremediation of piggery wastewaters at high loading rates', 'cites': '300', 'year': '2009', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960852409003770', 'author': 'Ignacio De Godos and Saúl Blanco and Pedro A García-Encina and Eloy Becares and Raúl Muñoz', 'journal': 'Bioresource Technology', 'volume': '100', 'number': '19', 'pages': '4332-4339', 'publisher': 'Elsevier', 'abstract': 'The performance of two 464-L high rate algal ponds (HRAPs) treating 20-and 10-folds diluted swine manure at 10 days of hydraulic residence time was evaluated under continental climatic conditions in Castilla y Leon (Spain) from January to October.
